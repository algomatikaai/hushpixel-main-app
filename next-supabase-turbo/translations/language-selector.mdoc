You can import and use the `LanguageSelector` component and drop it anywhere in your application to allow users to change the language of the application.

```tsx
import { LanguageSelector } from '@kit/ui/language-selector';

<LanguageSelector />
```

This component is automatically populated with the languages that you have defined in the `i18n` configuration. When a user selects a language, the application will automatically change the language and update the UI.

It is already part of the Account settings when more than one language is defined in the `i18n` configuration. If you want, add it to any other part of your application.
