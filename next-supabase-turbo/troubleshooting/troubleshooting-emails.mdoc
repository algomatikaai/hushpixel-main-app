To troubleshoot emails issues in the Next.js Supabase kit, please make sure to:

1. **Correct Credentials**: please make sure you have setup the correct credentials in your environment variables. Refer to the [emails guide](../emails/email-configuration) for more information.
2. **Your domain is verified**: make sure your domain is verified in your Email provider
3. **The Database Webhooks are configured**: make sure you have configured the Database Webhooks in your Supabase project. Refer to the [Supabase deployment guide](../going-to-production/supabase) for more information. Make sure to read Webhooks are pointing to the correct URL and use the correct shared secret.
4. **The Webhooks use a public URL**: make sure the webhooks use a public URL and not behind authentication (such as a Vercel Preview URL).
5. **Read the Logs**: please verify your server logs in your hosting provider to see if there are any errors related to emails.

If you have done all the above and still having issues, please open a Support Ticket in Discord.
