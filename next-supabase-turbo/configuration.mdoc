Makerkit uses a configuration-first approach, making it easy to customize your application without diving into the code. The configuration layer acts as a bridge between your environment variables and the application, ensuring type-safety and validation.

### How Configuration Works in Makerkit

Configuration in Makerkit follows a simple pattern:

1. Environment variables define the settings
2. Configuration files validate and parse these variables
3. The application consumes the validated configuration

This approach ensures your application never starts with invalid configuration, preventing runtime errors that could affect your users.

## Key Configuration Areas

### 📱 Application Configuration
The core settings of your application like name, URL, and metadata. This configuration defines how your application presents itself to users and search engines.

### 🔐 Authentication Configuration
Control which authentication methods are available to your users - from password-based auth to magic links and OAuth providers.

### 🚩 Feature Flags Configuration
Toggle features on/off across your application. Perfect for rolling out new features or maintaining different versions of your product.

### 🛣️ Paths Configuration
Define the routing structure of your application. This configuration helps maintain consistent navigation across your app.

## Environment Variables

All configuration ultimately stems from environment variables. These variables let you maintain different settings across environments without changing code.
