Makerkit provides a set of email templates that you can use for replacing the standard Supabase Auth emails. Additionally, you can customize these templates to match your brand.

**Please update the auth emails using the [following documentation in Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates#redirecting-the-user-to-a-server-side-endpoint)**.

{% alert type="warning" %}
Failure to do so will result in hiccups in the authentication flow when users click on an email and get redirected to a different browser than the one they used to sign up due to how the PKCE flow works.
{% /alert %}

## Setting the Email Templates in Supabase

Why should you use our email templates?

1. They will use the token hash strategy, which remediates the issue of users being redirected to a different browser than the one they used to sign up.
2. They look better than the default Supabase templates and you can customize them to match your brand.

## Customizing the Email Templates

Please clone the templates repository locally and customize them to your liking:

1. Clone our Emails Starter at [https://github.com/makerkit/makerkit-emails-starter](https://github.com/makerkit/makerkit-emails-starter)
2. Customize the templates as you see fit
3. Export the templates with your own information
4. Replace the templates in the `apps/web/supabase/templates` folder
5. Update the email templates in your Supabase settings

Now your emails from Supabase Auth will look great and match your brand! ðŸŽ‰
