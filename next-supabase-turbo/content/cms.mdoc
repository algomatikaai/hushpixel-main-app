Makerkit implements a CMS interface that abstracts the implementation from where you store your data. It provides a simple API to interact with your data, and it's easy to extend and customize.

By default, Makerkit ships with two CMS implementations: 

1. [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com) - a CMS that stores data in a JSON file or on your Github repository
2. [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) - needs no introduction

You can also create your own CMS implementation by extending the `CMS` class.

By default, we use Keystatic using `local` mode (eg. storing data in a JSON file). You can change the mode to `github` to store data in your Github repository or `cloud` to use their cloud service.

Local mode is the easiest way to get started since you need no setup. However, assuming you want to use edge-rendering, you'll need to switch to a remote mode (eg. Github) or a remote-only CMS (eg. Wordpress).
