The Translations Editor is a tool that allows you to edit translations and use AI to translate them.

It's a simple editor that allows you to edit translations for your project.

## Set Open AI API Key

First, you need to set the Open AI API Key in the `apps/e2e/.env.local` file.

```bash apps/e2e/.env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

Either make sure your key has access to the `gpt-4o-mini` model or set the `LLM_MODEL_NAME` environment variable to whichever model you have access to.

## Adding a new language

First, you need to add the language to the `apps/web/lib/i18n.settings.ts` file as described in the [Adding Translations](/docs/next-supabase-turbo/translations/adding-translations) documentation.

## Generate Translations with AI

The Translations Editor allows you to generate translations with AI.

You can use the AI to translate the translations for you by clicking the "Translate missing with AI" button.

## Editing Translations

Every time you update a translation, it will be saved automatically to the same file it's defined in.
