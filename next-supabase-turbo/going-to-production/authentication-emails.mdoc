## Setting the Email Templates in Supabase

Why should you use our email templates?

**Please update the auth emails using the [following documentation in Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates#redirecting-the-user-to-a-server-side-endpoint)**.

{% alert type="warning" %}
Failure to do so will result in hiccups in the authentication flow when users click on an email and get redirected to a different browser than the one they used to sign up due to how the PKCE flow works.
{% /alert %}

1. They will use the token hash strategy, which remediates the issue of users being redirected to a different browser than the one they used to sign up.
2. They look better than the default Supabase templates and you can customize them to match your brand.

## Customizing the Email Templates

Please clone the templates repository locally and customize them to your liking:

1. **Emails Starter**: Clone our Emails Starter at [https://github.com/makerkit/makerkit-emails-starter](https://github.com/makerkit/makerkit-emails-starter). This repository contains a [React.Email](https://react.email/) project with the email templates already set up.
2. **Customize the templates**: Next, you want to customize the templates as you see fit. For example, adding your product name, logo, and other branding elements.
3. **Export the templates**: Export the templates with your own information
4. **Replace the templates**: Replace the templates in the `apps/web/supabase/templates` folder
5. **Update the email templates in your Supabase settings**: Update the email templates in your Supabase's instance settings so that they use your custom templates.

Now your emails from Supabase Auth will look great and match your brand! ðŸŽ‰
