# Data Fetching in Makerkit

Makerkit provides a robust approach to fetching and managing data in your Next.js Supabase application. Whether you're building server components, handling real-time updates, or managing client-side state, Makerkit offers patterns and utilities to make data fetching clean and efficient.

## Data Loading Patterns

Common patterns for loading data include:

- Server Component data fetching for initial page loads
- React Query for client-side data management
- Server Actions for mutations
