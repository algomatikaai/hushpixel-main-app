---

The kit already comes with pre-configured LLM rules for Cursor and Windsurf.
Nothing else is required to use these rules.

## Additional context for LLMs

You can generate a set of Markdown files using our little script and the [open source Makerkit documentation](https://github.com/makerkit/documentation).

You can then use the Markdown files as a knowledge base for your LLMs, such as Cursor, ChatGPT or Claude.

Clone the repository, then run the following command:

```bash
node index.js kits/next-supabase-turbo
```

To ensure a more precise context, always scope the generation for the kit you are interested in. For example, to generate the markdown files for the Remix Supabase Kit, run the following command:

```bash
node index.js kits/remix-supabase-turbo
```

You can also do it for the courses by running the following command:

```bash
node index.js courses
```

This will generate markdown files in the dist folder.

You can configure how many words per file by passing a second argument to the script, e.g.:

```bash
node index.js kits 4000
```

By default, it will generate 5000 words per file.
