Makerkit provides a set of tools to ensure code health and quality in your project. This includes setting up Github Actions, pre-commit hooks, and more.

## Github Actions

By default, Makerkit sets up Github Actions to run tests on every push to the repository. You can find the Github Actions configuration in the `.github/workflows` directory.

The workflow has two jobs:

1. `typescript` - runs the Typescript compiler to check for type errors.
2. `test` - runs the Playwright tests in the `tests` directory.

### Enable E2E Tests

Since it needs some setup - these are not enabled by default. To enable E2E tests, you need to set the following environment variables in the Github Actions workflow:

```bash
ENABLE_E2E_JOB=true
```

### Configuring the E2E environment for Github Actions
To set up Github Actions for your project, please add the following secrets to your repository Github Actions settings:

1. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - the service role key for Supabase.
2. `SUPABASE_DB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - the webhook secret for Supabase.
3. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - the secret key for Stripe.
4. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - the webhook secret for Stripe.

These are the same as the ones you have running the project locally. Don't use real secrets here - use the development app secrets that you use locally. **This is a testing environment**, and you don't want to expose your production secrets.

Additionally, please set the following environment variables in the Github Actions workflow:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - this is the publishable key for Stripe.
2. `SUPABASE_DB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Use the value `WEBHOOKSECRET` for the webhook secret. Again, this is a testing environment, so we add testing values.

### Enable Stripe Tests

Since it needs some setup - these are not enabled by default. To enable Stripe tests, you need to set the following environment variables in the Github Actions workflow:

```bash
ENABLE_BILLING_TESTS=true
```

Of course - make sure you have the Stripe secrets set up in the Github Actions secrets.

## Pre-Commit Hook

It's recommended to set up a pre-commit hook to ensure that your code is linted correctly and passes the typechecker before committing.

### Setting up the Pre-Commit Hook

To do so, create a `pre-commit` file in the `./.git/hooks` directory with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
```

Turborepo will execute the commands for all the affected packages - while skipping the ones that are not affected.

### Make the Pre-Commit Hook Executable

Now, make the file executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

To test the pre-commit hook, try to commit a file with linting errors or type errors. The commit should fail, and you should see the error messages in the console.

### What about the e2e tests?

You could also add tests - but it'll slow down your commits. It's better to run tests in Github Actions.
